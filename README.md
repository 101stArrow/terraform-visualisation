# Terraform Visualisation Library

This will create a bucket, cloudfront and private waf for [Terraform Visual](https://hieven.github.io/terraform-visual/)

You will just need to add the relevant parts to your buildspec or other build tool to push to that bucket during build with the files

I will build a lambda to automate this in time
